## Introduction
This is a repostiory for the solutions I have written for the excellent [Python Challenges](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) series.

The solutions are written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/).

## Running
To run a particular challenge, type and input the number when prompted
    sbt run

To run all the challenges
    sbt test

## Shameless plug
You can view my musings about each particular solution on my blog [located here](http://djhworld.posterous.com/)

## Why did you do challenge X like that? You're an idiot!
I'm sorry you feel that way, I'm using these challenges as a means for me to learn Scala and a few of the functional concepts. I'm pretty certain there are better ways than my clumsy offerings, if you feel that way feel free to fork my feeble attempts and show me your solutions - everyone wins that way.
